PokeDex v 2.0

First you need to have a Java runtime/sd kit installed. Get this from http://java.sun.com

You need to set your paths, and then run

java -jar PokeDex.jar

At the command prompt. Case matters. If you are really good, you can make a shortcut to this by putting

"%javapath&\bin\java -jar PokeDex.jar"

As the program to run, where %javapath% is the path to the installed java kit. You should also set the start in folder to wherever you keep the *.jar and *.pkmn files.
